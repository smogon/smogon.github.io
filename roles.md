# Roles

## Separated

- **Owners**: Owners of [smogon.com](https://smogon.com) / [pokemonshowdown.com](https://pokemonshowdown.com).
- **Core**: [Core development team members](https://github.com/orgs/smogon/people) - active contributors who have made a sufficient number of quality contributions to the project, whether or not they are programmers or not.

## Visible/Taggable

- **Programmer**: someone who programs. Does not require being 'Programmer' badgeholder on Smogon or being a member of the global Technical Staff on PS, its just a way of indicating what hat you wear.
- **Researcher**: similar to above (no Smogon badge requirement), but someone who does mechanics research, and would likely be able to answer game mechanics questions that pop up.
- **Artist**: as above (no Smogon badge requirement), but someone who is an artist/designer and would be able to provide their insight on a UI/UX design change or similar.
- **Policy**: someone who handles policy/moderation/manages a PS/Smogon community. If input on how a tech change may affect policy is required, `@Policy` may be used. Substantial policy changes would still require proper discussion in other mediums (PS `<<staff>>` room or Smogon staff forums), but initial opinions on these matters could be helpful.

## ACLs

- **Owners**/**Admin** - admin privileges on the Discord server. Currently defined to be only PS Tech Admins.
- **Trusted** - users with access to private code and the `#private-dev` channel which is **only** to be used for discussion of work on that code. Assigned as needed.
- **Staff** - able to see the `#staff` channel, purely used for meta discussion of running the Discord server itself. Anyone who can see the `<<dev>>`-room `/staffintro` on PS or is a Community Leader or above on Smogon automatically qualify, as do active and involved badgeholders/contributors with the community on a case-by-case basis (Admin discretion).
